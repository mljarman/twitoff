Monday December 16:

1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

* So far so good, everything has gone well.

2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

* Everything seems straight forward. It was interesting learning about the flow of web apps and all that goes into front-end and back-end production.

3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

* I would say not necessarily challenging but intimidating is the Pipfile and making sure everything is installed correctly.
